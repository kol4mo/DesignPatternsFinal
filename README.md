# Design Patterns in C#

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental design patterns in C#:

- **Singleton** â€“ Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Bridge** â€“ Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **State Machine** â€“ Allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

Each pattern is implemented with simplicity and clarity in mind, and accompanied by unit tests to ensure correctness.



## ðŸ§ª Testing

The project uses **NUnit** for unit testing. You can run the tests via:

```bash
dotnet test
Make sure NUnit and NUnit3TestAdapter packages are installed in the test project.

âœ… Getting Started
Clone the repository, open in Visual Studio or VS Code, and run the solution. Each folder is standalone and showcases the core of the respective design pattern.
